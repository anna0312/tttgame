# Mystery Science Tic Tac Toe


## Technologies used
HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, and the various configuration packages and
linters available to me through the template

## Planning
Time management and project organization is frequently an issue for me, and this
instance was no different. I started out with the following plan:

1: Make wireframes (see below)
2: Write user stories (see below)
3: Break user stories down into feature sets
4: Build out authentication
5: Build api calls to get authentication and game creation working
6: Build out game play and scoring logic and functions
7: Build out game play features using said scoring logic and functions
8: Build remaining UI
9: Make pretty
10: Build AWESOME additional functionality AND complete the bonus.

Obviously I never got to step 10.

The good news is that I did wind up sticking to that process, for the most part.
The bad news is that I completely underestimated how long building the UI would
take, and how much I would get hung up on the final "make pretty" part.

## What I sucked at
Aside from the afore mentioned time management, I also did a terrible job using
sass and organizing my html into thoughtful and consistent patterns. These were
part of the last couple of items in my plannign list and obviously bear the
scars of my running out of time (see: poor time management.)

I am also not very confident in the organization of my javascript. I tried to
separate it all out into logical concerns but fear I may have mis-organized some
of it. It works, so that's good. But could have been done more elegantly

## What I'm proud of
I focused a lot on trying to find elegant (read: as few lines as possible)
solutions to some of the game logic problems, and used this as an opportunity to
practice what we learned about array iterations, which was something that I
had a tough time with. While I'm no iteration ninja, I definitely feel like this
has made me a lot more comfortable with them.

I had fun playing with the responses to the players and even added some
annoying animations just for giggles. Apologies in advance if it's too much.

Also, I like my MST3K audience.

### User stories
As a user I should be able to create an account containing an email, password, and name
As a user I should be able to log in
As a user I should be able to start a new game
As a user I should be able to select a square
As a user I should see if my square selection caused me to win the game
As a user I should be able to forfeit a game
As a user I should be able to see my scoring history
